# After spending more than 8 years learning in a scattered manner without focusing on anything specific, I have decided today to start from scratch and focus on the fundamentals. I aim to easily navigate between different fields, so I have decided to begin learning:

1-Computer Basics
2-Programming
3-Networks
4-Databases
