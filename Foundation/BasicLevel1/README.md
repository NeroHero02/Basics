In this section, I will summarize the basics that programmers need to know.

## Data vs Information 
When I tell you that I have Temperature data for the past 100 years, and these data are facts, but currently, I don't benefit from them. But when I tell you that the temperature increases by 5% each year, this has become information. Therefore, the information is derived from the data I have; thus, information is represented as:

Data : Temerature in the past 100 Years.
-Process : 
- Structure it. 
- Organize it. 
- Analyze it. 
- Give it a meaning.
Information : Global Temperature is raising.
Data + Meaning = Information
