In this section, I will summarize the basics that programmers need to know.

## Data vs Information 
When I tell you that I have Temperature data for the past 100 years, and these data are facts, but currently, I don't benefit from them. But when I tell you that the temperature increases by 5% each year, this has become information. Therefore, the information is derived from the data I have; thus, information is represented as:
```
Data : Temerature in the past 100 Years.
Process : 
- Structure it. 
- Organize it. 
- Analyze it. 
- Give it a meaning.
Information : Global Temperature is raising.
Data + Meaning = Information
```
The difference between data and information.
1. Data : 
 - Raw facts
 - Unstructured/Unorganized
 - Unanalyzed
 - Unprocessed
 - Has no meaning

2. Information
 - Driven from data
 - Structured/Organized
 - Analyzed
 - Processed
 - Has meaning

 ## Knowledge vs Wisdom

Data&rarr;<sup>Input</sup> Processing &rarr;<sup>Output</sup> Information &rarr;<sup>With Time</sup> Knowledge &rarr;<sup>Applied</sup> Wisdom

Data is the foundation, and when processed are performed on it, it transforms into information. Over time, this information evolves into knowledge, and when applied, it becomes expertise. Therefore, having knowledge doesn't necessarily mean you are an expert; applying that knowledge is crucial to becoming an expert.
