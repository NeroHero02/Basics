# Started

**Here we will start by talking about some things before starting to learn programming.**  

## Why to Start with C++? 

**C++ = Salary++**  

## What is C++?  

- C++ : is a cross-platform/Portable language that can be used to create high-performance applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.   
- C++ is fun and easy to learn!.  
- C++ is the mother of all languages.  
- It Supports Procedural & OOP programming.  
- It will force you learn basic programming concepts.  
- If you learn it very well, you can learn any other programming language in less than a month's time.  
- Both C and C++ are considered Mid-level languages that are close to hardware and are able to program and manipulate the underlying hardware resources.  
- C and C++ have full control on computer resources such as memory, no automatic memory management.  

## What can you do with C++?  

- To Design OS  
- Desktop Applications  
- Design Compilers/Programming Languages  
- Design Database  
- Game Development  
- Medical Applications  
- Design Web Browsers  
- Embedded Systems  
- Computation Platforms  
- Built Enterprise Software  
- IDEs  

## Real things done using C++ (Real Applications)  

1. Operating Systems:  
  - Windows
  - Apple OS X

2. Applications:  
  - Adobe  
  - Core Functions are written in C++  
  - Amazon was primarily written in C++  
  - Microsoft products like Word, Excelt ...etc.  
  - Browsers
    - Firefox
    - Google Chrome
  - Databases
    - MySQL
    - PostgreSQL
  - Gaming Engines
  - IDEs
    - VisualStudios
  - Enterprise Software
    - C++ is used in developing many enterprise software as well as advanced applications like flight simulation aqnd radar processing.  
  - Compilers and Programming Languages  
  - Embedded Systems  
    - CARs, Flights, Medical Machines, and others.  
  
Note : C++ is faster than most of the other programming languages and also supports multithreading with concurrency.  

**Then if you need**

- Performance
- Speed
- Cross Platform/Adaptable
- High-level mathematical computations
- Multithreading with concurrency

You Should Use C++.
