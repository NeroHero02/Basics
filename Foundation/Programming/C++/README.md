**In this section, we will begin to learn and explain the details of the basics of the language C++.**  

## C++ Code Structure  

```cpp
# include <iostream>

int main()
{
std::cout << "Osama Sbeih";
return 0;
}
```
**Output:**
```
Osama Sbeih
```
- #include : include the library for me.  
- #include <iostream> :include the iostream library for me.  
- std::cout << "Osama Sbeih"; : The command cout is within the std (standard) namespace, and this command is used to print what we write. It is an abbreviation for "Console out".  
- int main() : is a requirement for any C++ program, as it must contain a function named main. It serves as the entry point of the program, and it is the first thing executed when the program is run. Everything between the curly braces {} following main gets executed.  
- return 0;: Every function needs a return value, and we will discuss it later.
