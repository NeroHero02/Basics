In this section, I will summarize some important concepts.

## Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

- It is a medium-sized network Larger than LAN and Smaller than WAN
- MAN can cover a broad area such as cities and towns.

## Different Between Man and WAN

MAN

- MAN stands for Metropolitan Area Network
- Faster Transmission Speed ,less latency
- Less noise and error
- MAN has moderate congestion
- Low cost of installation & design

WAN 

- WAN stands for Wide Area Network
- Slower Transmission Speed , high letancy
- More noise and error
- WAN has high congestion
- High cost of installation and design 


## What is Server 

Server : is a type of computer that shares information with other computers.

- The ultimate function of a server is to receive,store,process, and share data.
- It provides services to others.

<span style="color: red;">Important: Server can be a software</span>  
<a id="example"></a>  
Example : A typical PC (Desktop or Laptop) + Apache HTTP Server (Software) = Web Server

## Different Between Server and PC

Server

- High Relaiability & Dependability
- High Performance
- Can run for years without shutdown
- Less mainance cost
- High Price

PC

- Less Relaiability & Dependability
- Less Performance
- Cannot run for years without shutdown
- High maintenance cost
- Less Price

## Types of Server

- Web Server (Like [Example](#example))
- Mail Server
- Application Server
- Database Server
- File Server
- Image Server
- VoIP Server
- Game Server
- Printing/Fax Server
- Many Other Servers

## Forms of Servers

- Tower (Standalone like PC)
- Rack  (Fits in 19" Mounting Rack)
- Blade (Fits in 19" Mounting Rack)

## Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

Responsible for :

- TCP defines how applications can create channels of communication across a network
- It also manages how a message is assembled into smaller packets before they are then transmitted over the internet.
- and reassembled in the right order at the destination address.

## Internet Protocol (IPv4)

- Every computer on an Ethernet network is given an IP address.
- An IP address, like your home's street address, identifies network machines.
- Because each computer has it own IP address, it aids traffic flow between them.
- (IP address) is a numerical identifier that is connected with a certain computer or computer network.
- When computers are connected to the internet or Network, the IP address alows them to send and receive data.
- The acronym IP stand for "Internet Protocol", which is a collection of rules that regulate the format of data transferred over the internet or a local network.

## Internet Protocol (IPv6)
- IPv6 Address Format (Hexadecimal Notation)
16 Bytes = 128 Bits.  
Example : 2001:0db8:0000:0000:ff00:0000:0042:8330

## Types of IP Address 

Four Types:  
- Public 
- Private
- Static
- Dynamic

## Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 

- DHCP is a client/server protocol that automatically provides an Internet Protocol (IP).

## Internet Service Provider

- ISP a company that provides Internet connections and services to indivduals and organizations.

## Port & Socket 

- IP Address + Port = Socket Address.  
- In networking, a socket is used to allow many processes within a single or different host to use TCP communication simultaneously.  
- a port is a number assigned to uniquely identify a connection endpoint and to direct data to a specific service.

## Subnet Mask

- Subnetting is the practice of dividing a network into two or more smaller networks. It increases routing efficiency, enhances the security of the network.  
- Network Identifier : The first part of the IP address is the network identifier that identifies the network segment in which the computer is located. The same network identifier is required for all computer in the same segment, just as all houses in a particular county must have the same postal code.  
- The second part of the IP address is the host identifier, which identifies a computer, router , or other device within a segment. The host identifier must be unique within the network segment, just as the street name for a house within the postcode area must be unique.

## Mac Address

- Media Accesss Control address : is a hardware identifier that uniquely identifies each device on a network. Primarily, the manufacturer assigns it.  
- MAC address is a unique number which is used to track a device in a network.  
- MAC address provides a secure way to find senders or receivers in the network.
- It helps prevent unwanted network access.
- Mac address is also used in Wi-Fi networks at the airport for a specfic device in order to identifiy it.
