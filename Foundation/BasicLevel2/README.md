In this section, I will summarize some important concepts.

## Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

- It is a medium-sized network Larger than LAN and Smaller than WAN
- MAN can cover a broad area such as cities and towns.

## Different Between Man and WAN

MAN

- MAN stands for Metropolitan Area Network
- Faster Transmission Speed ,less latency
- Less noise and error
- MAN has moderate congestion
- Low cost of installation & design

WAN 

- WAN stands for Wide Area Network
- Slower Transmission Speed , high letancy
- More noise and error
- WAN has high congestion
- High cost of installation and design 


## What is Server 

Server : is a type of computer that shares information with other computers.

- The ultimate function of a server is to receive,store,process, and share data.
- It provides services to others.

<span style="color: red;">Important: Server can be a software</span>

Example : A typical PC (Desktop or Laptop) + Apache HTTP Server (Software) = Web Server

## Different Between Server and PC

Server

- High Relaiability & Dependability
- High Performance
- Can run for years without shutdown
- Less mainance cost
- High Price

PC

- Less Relaiability & Dependability
- Less Performance
- Cannot run for years without shutdown
- High maintenance cost
- Less Price

## Types of Server

- Web Server (Like [Example](#example))
- Mail Server
- Application Server
- Database Server
- File Server
- Image Server
- VoIP Server
- Game Server
- Printing/Fax Server
- Many Other Servers

## Forms of Servers

- Tower (Standalone like PC)
- Rack  (Fits in 19" Mounting Rack)
- Blade (Fits in 19" Mounting Rack)

## Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

Responsible for :

- TCP defines how applications can create channels of communication across a network
- It also manages how a message is assembled into smaller packets before they are then transmitted over the internet.
- and reassembled in the right order at the destination address.

## Internet Protocol (IPv4)

- Every computer on an Ethernet network is given an IP address.
- An IP address, like your home's street address, identifies network machines.
- Because each computer has it own IP address, it aids traffic flow between them.
- (IP address) is a numerical identifier that is connected with a certain computer or computer network.
- When computers are connected to the internet or Network, the IP address alows them to send and receive data.
- The acronym IP stand for "Internet Protocol", which is a collection of rules that regulate the format of data transferred over the internet or a local network.
